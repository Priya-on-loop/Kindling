"""
Career Graph Phase 2 orchestration: takes Phase 1's deterministic
tree (career_tree.build_career_tree) and fills in the AI-generated
display strings — field short names, career short titles, "why it's
connected", and "try it out" — via ai_core/tree_naming.py, caching
each in the generated_strings table (backend/db.py) so repeat visits
are stable and cheap, exactly per Part E rule 7 of the master prompt.

Field names, career short titles, and "try it" text are session-
independent (the same real occupation/task always gets the same
treatment) and cached globally by occupation/task/field code alone.
"why it's connected" depends on a specific user's real evidence, so
its cache key includes a hash of that evidence.

Cache hits are read synchronously first (cheap local reads); only
genuine cache misses dispatch a real LLM call, and those independent
calls run concurrently — a cold cache of ~60 calls took ~220s run
sequentially in testing, which isn't a reasonable wait for a live
page load. This is still Phase 2's own orchestration, not a Phase 3
API concern.
